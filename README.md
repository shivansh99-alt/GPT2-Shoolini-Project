# GPT2-Shoolini-Project
This project demonstrates fine-tuning a GPT-2 language model on a custom dataset related to Shoolini University. Using Hugging Face's Transformers library, we train a smaller GPT-2 model to generate coherent text responses based on university-specific content. It's a hands-on example of natural language processing (NLP) for domain adaptation.
